Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

When ashvatthama realeased the brahmastra at arjuna, arjuna prayed to Krishna to remove His fear and protect Him. Radhey-Shyam.

Janmadyasyata 'nvyad itaratas charteshvabhigyasvarat
tene brahma hrda ya adi kavaye muhyanti yad surya
tejo vari mrdam yatha vinimayo yatra tri sargo 'mrsha
dhamna svena sada nirasta kuhakam satyam param dhimahi
